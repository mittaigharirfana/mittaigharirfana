The AI engineer successfully built a pixel-perfect clone of , implementing a full-stack e-commerce application. Initial work involved frontend scaffolding with mock data, followed by backend development with FastAPI and MongoDB for product management and Razorpay integration. Key architectural decisions included using React for the frontend, Shadcn UI components, and a  prefix for backend routes. Post-MVP, an admin panel for product/order management and social media links were added. Significant effort was then dedicated to guiding the user through Google Play Store deployment using Capacitor, including an  file generation. The most recent focus has been on resolving image loading issues due to incorrect URLs and ensuring all product and category images from the user's catalog are correctly displayed, with a temporary fix using placeholders and an ongoing effort to use the user-provided images.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a pixel-perfect clone of , encompassing its design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and structure. The application needed to be a fully functional e-commerce platform with a working cart, order processing, and Razorpay payment integration.
**Features Implemented:**
-   **Frontend:** Replicated UI, navigation, product display, product detail, shopping cart, wishlist, about page, user login/signup, checkout flow, order success, orders history, and user profile.
-   **Backend:** MongoDB models for products, categories, users, orders, and status checks. CRUD API endpoints, business logic, and error handling. Integrated Razorpay for payments.
-   **Admin Panel:** Secure admin login, dashboard, and management interfaces for products, orders, and settings.
-   **Contact & Social Media:** Integrated business mobile number (8978152777), WhatsApp link, Facebook, and Instagram links.
-   **Deployment:** Converted the web app to an Android app ( file) using Capacitor for Google Play Store submission.
-   **Content Update:** Updated product names, prices, and images based on a user-provided catalog.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router DOM, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Axios.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (via ), ,  library.
-   **Deployment/Mobile:** Capacitor (for web-to-Android conversion).
-   **Database:** MongoDB,  for async operations.
-   **API Design:** RESTful principles,  prefix for all backend routes.

<code_architecture>
The application is a full-stack project with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   : Main React component defining routing () and integrating  and . Updated to include admin routes.
-   : Navigation component, recently updated to include business contact and social media links.
-   : Footer component, recently updated with business contact and social media links.
-   : Contains initial mock data for frontend development, later replaced by backend API calls.
-   : Contains all public-facing and user-authenticated pages like , , , , , , , , , etc. These were initially using  and later updated to fetch data from the backend.
-   : Contains all admin-specific pages: , , , , , and .
-   : FastAPI application entry point, includes API routes, CORS middleware, and database shutdown event. Modified extensively to include product, category, user, order, and admin authentication endpoints, as well as Razorpay integration.
-   : Defines Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB interaction (e.g., , , , , ).
-   : Contains utility functions for database interactions, like seeding initial data.
-   : Script to populate the MongoDB with initial product and category data.
-   : Document outlining API contracts, mocked data, backend implementation plans, and frontend-backend integration strategy.
-   : A one-off script used to update the database with product and category information (names, prices, images) from the user's provided catalog PDF.
-   : A temporary script used to replace inaccessible image URLs with working placeholder images.
-   : Script to update product images based on URLs provided in an Excel file.
-   : Script to update category images specifically.
-   : Directory containing pre-built Shadcn UI components used throughout the frontend.
-   : Document created to guide the user on generating APK/AAB and uploading to Google Play Store using Android Studio.
-   : Document created to guide the user on managing products through the admin panel.

<pending_tasks>
-   Google Play Console identity verification approval is pending from Google's side.
-   Full set of publicly accessible product images from the user is still needed for all 47 products (user provided some, but not all are loaded).
-   The admin panel login  on the deployed website is not functioning as expected.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the issue of missing and incorrect images on the deployed Freshwala website. After the user reported NO IMAGES IN APP AND EVEN APP COMPLETELY DISTURBED, the AI investigated and determined that the previously provided catalog image URLs were not publicly accessible (resulting in 403 errors).

The AI then implemented a temporary fix by running  to update all product and category images with working placeholder URLs to restore basic functionality and visual structure.

Most recently, the user confirmed that product images were showing, but category images were still missing (showing empty circles). The AI addressed this by creating and running  to specifically update the category images with appropriate placeholder URLs. The last action was to restart the backend server to apply these changes.

The current state of the product is that the Freshwala website is deployed and functional, with an e-commerce flow, Razorpay integration, admin panel, and social media links. Placeholder images are currently used for categories and some products, while a subset of product images has been updated using publicly accessible URLs provided by the user. The primary remaining technical task is to fully integrate all correct, publicly accessible images from the user's catalog. Simultaneously, the user is being guided through the Google Play Console submission process, which is currently paused awaiting Google's identity verification.

<optional_next_step>
Restart the backend server and take a screenshot of the  homepage to verify that the category images are now loading correctly.
