The AI engineer's work trajectory chronicles the development and deployment efforts for the Freshwala e-commerce application. Initially, it involved fixing image loading issues by updating  and  and using AI-generated images. Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing the admin panel and guiding the user through Google Play Store deployment. This phase encountered persistent challenges: a non-functional admin login (due to routing/deployment environment confusion), followed by recurrent build failures for the Android App Bundle (AAB) in Android Studio, primarily related to  dependency issues. A major setback was the loss of the original keystore, preventing app updates. Consequently, the team decided to pursue a fresh start by creating a new app. The most recent efforts focused on preparing a new Android project with a new package name, addressing the  build errors within the agent's environment, and creating a working AAB. The current state has the user successfully opening this freshly prepared project in Android Studio, poised for the final build.

The user requested a pixel-perfect clone of , functioning as a full-stack e-commerce platform with a working cart, order processing, and Razorpay integration. Key features implemented include:
-   **Frontend:** Replicated UI, navigation, product display, shopping cart, wishlist, login/signup, checkout flow, order history.
-   **Backend:** MongoDB models (products, categories, users, orders), CRUD API, Razorpay.
-   **Admin Panel:** Secure login, dashboard, product/order management.
-   **Contact & Social Media:** Integrated business number, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram links.
-   **Deployment:** Converted to Android app () using Capacitor for Google Play Store.
-   **Content Update:** Products and categories updated with images (initially from user catalog, then AI-generated/public URLs).
The current goal is to successfully deploy a fully functional Android app to the Google Play Store, effectively resolving past build and keystore issues by starting a new app submission.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving persistent  build errors in Android Studio. Due to continuous keystore mismatch issues preventing updates to the original Freshwala app, the decision was made to start a *new* app. The AI updated the Android project's package name to  and made necessary configuration adjustments within the , , and  files to ensure proper web content bundling and  module linkage. A new, fixed Android project package () was generated and provided to the user. The user has successfully downloaded and extracted this package and opened it in Android Studio. The project structure now visibly includes the  module, indicating that the previous dependency fix has been applied. The current state is that the user needs to confirm that Gradle sync completes successfully within Android Studio before proceeding to generate the AAB file for the new app.
